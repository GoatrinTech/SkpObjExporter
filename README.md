# SkpObjExporter
A obj exporter for Sketchup Make 2017. Made with ruby.
This obj exporter is free and open source. I have nothing 
to do with Trimble Sketchup. Put in the directory: <br>
-<disk(i.e. C:/)> <br>
--Users <br>
---<your_user> <br>
----AppData <br>
-----Roaming <br>
------SketchUp <br>
-------SketchUp 2017 <br>
--------SketchUp <br>
---------Plugins <br>
---------- <Here you will find a bunch of plugins you have installed. Most of the plugins have tt_ at the start 
of the name. It dosen't matter what you call yours, it should just show up in the sketchup extension manager
as 'Unsigned'. That should be fine. Just ignore it if it says 'Signed' or 'Unsigned'. I don't know the difference.
Put the plugin in this folder, ignore the other folders. When you launch SketchUp Make 2017 it should say
'Export to OBJ' in the 'File' drop down. When you launch SketchUp and it gives you a error, too bad. I guess
you can edit the file for the error.> <br>

This plugin will export your current model as a .obj file. There will also be your material files, and your .mtl file.
Github Copilot helped me make this plugin. I will continue to develop this plugin. I do not guarantee this plugin
will work correctly. If you ever need to get rid of the plugin for some weird reason, then just delete the ruby source
file. Thank you for using my plugin. <br>
